# HubspotAppScriptPipelineReporting
GAS Application built to provide better sales pipeline reporting
Create Hubspot Developer Account to get Client ID and Secret
In Google sheets click tools and script editor to insert code. You have to create each page for each page variable that is listed at the top of the GS Script otherwise the script will not be able to identify the page for appending the data
Dont forget to set a trigger that runs the refresh function 
You can manually run functions direct from Appscripts by selecting the function and hitting the play button
to play around with end points I suggest using postman, retrieve your authentication token by printing it to the Logger.log
